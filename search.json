    "text": "This is my third digital design class at Harvey Mudd, starting with E85: Digital Electronics and Computer Engineering, followed by E154: System-on-Chip Design, and now E155: Microprocessor Systems Design and Application.\nLast summer I worked as a Physical Design intern at Tenstorrent, working on a RISC-V processor, so I am excited to get exposure to a completely different part of computer engineering, for very different applications.\nI expect this class to be quite challenging, particularly with time managament. My goals are to stay multiple days ahead of due dates—not my normal inclination—to avoid long nights and extra stress if possible.\nI am quite excited for a lot of the labs, particularly the 7 segment display lab, as well as the ditial audio lab. I think the 7 segment display is a very clear application that has a lot of uses, and I think it would be cool to connect multiple displays together to be able to print out longer messages. Additionally, as a musician, I am excited to work on the digital audio lab, and would be excited to expand this to include a keyboard.\nOverall, I am very excited to see where this class takes me."

Lab1 Github Repository\n\nBlock Diagram\n\n\nFigure 1: Block Diagram of the Verilog design.\n\nThe block diagram in Figure 1 demonstrates the overall architecture of the design. The top-level module top includes three submodules: the high-speed oscillator block (HSOSC), the clock divider module (divider), and the seven segment display decoder (display).\n\n\nSchematic\n\n\nFigure 2: Schematic of the Physical Circuit.\n\nFigure 2 shows the physical layout of the design. Note that led[3:0] have pins that were on the ribbon connector ports so that they could be passed to external LEDs on the breadboard due to a supply shortage of SMT diodes. Each led has a 1kcurrent-limiting resistor to ensure the output current, ~2.6 mA, does not exceed the maximum current rating for the FPGA GPIO pins."

    "section": "Results and Discussion",
    "text": "Results and Discussion\nI accomplished all of the perscribed tasks: the standalone LEDs and the seven segement display, all controlled by the 4 DIP switches. For the 2.4 Hz pulsing LED, my oscilloscope measured 2.402 Hz frequency, but there was quite a bit of noise on the rising and falling edge of the signal. I am not sure if this small error is a measure effect, or perhaps it is comming from the oscillator itself. Regarless, this shows that the clock divider circuit is working as intended.\n\nTestbench Simulation\nThe first testbench is to simulate the top level module. We can see the waveforms match the expected values. Note that for the simulation led[2] is floating because the oscillator is commented out because it cannot be simulated. Therefore, the expected output is led[1:0] appended in front of seg, giving us a 9 digit expected output.\n\n\nFigure 3: Top level module wave forms.\n\nNot only do we see the wave forms match, but we get a printout that all 16 possible permutations tests passed.\n\n\nFigure 4: Top level module testbench output.\n\nSimilarly for simulating the seven segment display module, we give the input switches s, and see the output seg matches the expected values.\n\n\nFigure 5: Seven segment display module waveforms.\n\nAgain, all 16 possible combinations of s matched the expectation.\n\n\nFigure 6: Seven segment display testbench output.\n\nNote, I did not write a testbench for the clock divider because it would simply be waiting millions of cycles for a single bit to change. However, I did connect an oscilloscope probe to the led on my breadboard and measure the period to be 2.4 Hz."

    "text": "Conclusion\nI worked on this lab for three consecutive days, totalling around 12 hours. This included around 3 hours to solder the board and get setup, a few hours working on the demos, before working on the project itself. Writting the verilog only took about 45 minutes, as the idioms are quite simple once you understand the clock divider logic.\nThe FPGA succesfully controlled both the seven segment display as well as the 3 standalone LEDs. The first two LEDs perform the XOR and AND functions correctly, and the third LED blinks at 2.4 Hz as desired."
